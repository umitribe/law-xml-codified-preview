    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>the Congress of the United States has enacted the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, as amended, 25 U.S.C. 461 et seq., which, in Section 17 thereof (25 U.S.C. ยง 477), authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to issue a federal corporate charter to an Indian Tribe; and</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>the Upper Mattaponi Tribe (herein the "Tribe") is a federally recognized Indian Tribe and is consequently recognized by the Internal Revenue Service as an Indian Tribal Government under the Tribal Governmental Tax Status Act (26 U.S.C. ยง 7871 et seq.).</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>the Upper Mattaponi Council (herein the "Council") is the governing body of the Tribe; and</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>

    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>the Council has found that the formation of UMT Holdings (the "Corporation") pursuant to a section 17 Charter will serve the best interests of the Tribe, its members and its enterprises and will protect the political integrity, economic security and health and welfare of the Tribe and its members by, among other things: 1) creating a legal structure which provides for the segregation of Tribe governmental assets and liabilities from Tribe business assets and liabilities, and 2) creating a legal structure which provides for the segregation of discrete Corporation assets and liabilities into separate Corporation subdivisions, without divesting either the Corporation or the Tribe of the privileges and immunities arising pursuant to their legal status under federal and Tribal law; and</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>the Upper Mattaponi Constitution does not include an impairment of contracts clause and the Tribe desires, by and through the Section 17 Charter of the Corporation, to provide assurance to business associates that the Corporation may enter into contracts without the Tribe subsequently enacting laws materially impairing such contracts other than as necessary to protect health or safety within the jurisdiction of the Tribe; and</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>the terms and provisions of this Charter were approved by the Council on _______________ pursuant to ________; and</text>

    <recital>
      <conjunction>NOW, THEREFORE,</conjunction>
      <text>I, Kimberly Bouchard, Eastern Regional Director, Bureau of Indian Affairs, by virtue of the power conferred upon the Secretary of the Interior by the said Act and delegated to me, do hereby issue this Charter of Incorporation to the Tribe for UMT Holdings, to be operative when ratified by the governing body of the Tribe.</text>
