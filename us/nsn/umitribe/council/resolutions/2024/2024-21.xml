The Tribe expressly waives any application of the exhaustion of tribal remedies doctrine that might otherwise require, as a matter of law or comity, that a dispute be heard first in a tribal court.  No action with respect to any disputes, controversies or claims between You, Rockefeller Financial and/or NFS arising in any way from Your accounts, orders, transactions, or the construction, performance or breach of this Addendum or any Agreement between or among the Parties may be brought in tribal court without the prior written consent of Rockefeller Financial and NFS.</text>

      </para>
      <para>

        <text>The rules of the arbitration forum in which the claim is filed, and any amendments thereto, shall be incorporated into this Addendum.</text>

If You designate the rules of a United States self-regulatory organization or United States securities exchange and those rules fail to be applied for any reason, then You shall designate the prevailing rules of any other United States securities self-regulatory organization or United States securities exchange of which the person, entity or entities against whom the claim is made is a member.

The designation of the rules of a United States self-regulatory organization or United States securities exchange is not integral to the underlying agreement to arbitrate.

Such forbearance to enforce an agreement to arbitrate shall not constitute a waiver of any rights under this Addendum except to the extent stated herein.</text>
